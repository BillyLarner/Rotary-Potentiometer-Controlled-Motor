# Rotary-Potentiometer-Controlled-Motor
A quick program to control the speed and direction of a motor using rotary potentiometer.

This program was created using the FreeNove's starter kit.

This project requires the following hardware:

  1x Arduino Uno

  1x Breadboard

  1x USB Cable

  1x DC Motor

  1x AA Battery holder

  1x L293D Chip

  1x Rotary Potentiometer

  2x M/F Cable

  10x M/M Cable

While running this program I noticed that the motor would run slower at values less than 512, im not sure what causes this however if this is a simple coding error I would appreciate the advice!
